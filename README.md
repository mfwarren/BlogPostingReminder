# Blog Posting Reminder
Simple script I use to remind myself to write weekly blog posts.  sends notification to me via telegram

To use, edit the SETTINGS variable with settings for your blog.
set environment variables for TELEGRAM API KEY and USER_ID (user id is an integer value and tricky to find)

Schedule the script to run, as often as you want to be nagged.

Happy blogging!
